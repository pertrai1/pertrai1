# Rob Simpson
    
    Software Engineer with 15+ years experience.
    
    I thoroughly enjoy **Meta-Learning** - understanding the mechanics of how we acquire and apply new knowledge.
    
    ## Currently Building & Learning (AI Engineering)
    
    My current focus is **"AI Engineering"** - understanding the low level design of RAG, embeddings, and model orchestration.
    
    * **PLANTS NLQI** - A Natural Language Query Interface for the USDA botanical database. Solving for accuracy in specialized scientific domains using RAG.
    * **OpenSpec Architecture** - Experimenting with declarative, YAML-based AI agent definitions to ensure developer-led control over agentic workflows.
    * **Model Translation** - Learning to port Python ML models to browser-ready TypeScript/TensorFlow.js to enable high-performance, client-side intelligence.
    * **508 Accessibility Tools** - Prototyping applications that help developers automate and verify Section 508/WCAG compliance in modern SPAs.
    
    ## Recent Activity & Experience (AI/ML & Development)
    
    * **AI Projects (`ai-projects` repository):** Developed and experimented with various AI concepts including:
        * **FieldGuide Assistant:** An AI-powered assistant for botanical information.
        * **Agent Orchestration:** Exploring multi-agent systems and their coordination.
        * Extensive documentation and research (Jan 2026) on Agents, RAG, LLMs, N-Shot Learning, and related AI topics.
    * **Contributions & Challenges (`coding-challenges` repository):**
        * Implemented a 'GFE Custom EventEmitter'.
        * Solved numerous Blind 75 and other LeetCode challenges, focusing on data structures and algorithms.
    * **Documentation (Jan 2026):** Authored comprehensive documentation on AI topics including Agents, RAG, LLMs, and N-Shot Learning.
    * **Research Paper Implementations**: Developed small-scale projects based on key research papers in the AI field to validate concepts and explore implementation details.
