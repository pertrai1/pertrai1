# Rob Simpson

Software Engineer with 15+ years experience.

I thoroughly enjoy **Meta-Learning** — understanding the mechanics of how we acquire and apply new knowledge.

## Currently Building & Learning

My current focus is **"AI Engineering"** — understanding the low level design of RAG, embeddings, and model orchestration.

* **PLANTS NLQI** — A Natural Language Query Interface for the USDA botanical database. Solving for accuracy in specialized scientific domains using RAG.
* **OpenSpec Architecture** — Experimenting with declarative, YAML-based AI agent definitions to ensure developer-led control over agentic workflows.
* **Model Translation** — Learning to port Python ML models to browser-ready TypeScript/TensorFlow.js to enable high-performance, client-side intelligence.
* **508 Accessibility Tools** — Prototyping applications that help developers automate and verify Section 508/WCAG compliance in modern SPAs.

## Code Challenge Platforms

I enjoy learning and challenging myself at these platforms:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/warlhord/)
- [greatfrontend](https://www.greatfrontend.com/)
- [Frontend Mentor](https://pertrai1.github.io/frontend-challenges/)
- [exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/pertrai1)

## My Funnest Repos

### [ai-projects](https://github.com/pertrai1/ai-projects)
*A lab for production-ready AI implementations.*
* **FieldGuide Assistant:** Multi-document RAG system focused on context-aware retrieval.
* **Agent Orchestration:** Building frameworks that keep the human "in the loop," prioritizing developer agency over autonomous agent control.

### [coding-challenges](https://github.com/pertrai1/coding-challenges)
*A laboratory for problem-solving and meta-learning.*
* **Learning How to Learn:** Using challenges as a medium to refine **Active Recall** and **Spaced Repetition** techniques in a technical context.
* **First Principles:** Breaking down complex problems into primitive patterns (Graph theory, Dynamic Programming, Sliding Windows) to build a reusable mental library for system design.
* **Process over Product:** Each solution is an exercise in documenting the "why"—translating abstract requirements into clean, performant TypeScript/Python code.
