# Rob Simpson

Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years experience in the government and enterprise sectors. Expertise in modern frameworks/libraries, modular component architecture, and cloud-enabled services. I specialize in transforming legacy monoliths into maintainable, accessible, and high-performance ecosystems.

I believe that in an era of rapid AI advancement, the most critical skill is **Meta-Learning**—understanding the mechanics of how we acquire and apply new knowledge.

## Currently Building & Learning

My current focus is shifting from "AI-assisted development" to **"AI Engineering"**—understanding the low level design of RAG, embeddings, and model orchestration.

* 🤖 **PLANTS NLQI** — A Natural Language Query Interface for the USDA botanical database. Solving for accuracy in specialized scientific domains using RAG.
* 📚 **OpenSpec Architecture** — Experimenting with declarative, YAML-based AI agent definitions to ensure developer-led control over agentic workflows.
* 💡 **Model Translation** — Learning to port Python ML models to browser-ready TypeScript/TensorFlow.js to enable high-performance, client-side intelligence.
* ♿ **508 Accessibility Tools** — Prototyping applications that help developers automate and verify Section 508/WCAG compliance in modern SPAs.
