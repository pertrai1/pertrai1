# Rob Simpson
    
Software Engineer with 15+ years experience.
    
I thoroughly enjoy **Meta-Learning** - understanding the mechanics of how we acquire and apply new knowledge.
    
## Currently Building & Learning (AI Engineering)
    
My current focus is **"AI Engineering"** - understanding the low level design of RAG, embeddings, and model orchestration.
    
* **PLANTS NLQI** - A Natural Language Query Interface for the USDA botanical database. Solving for accuracy in specialized scientific domains using RAG.
* **OpenSpec Architecture** - Experimenting with declarative, YAML-based AI agent definitions to ensure developer-led control over agentic workflows.
* **Model Translation** - Learning to port Python ML models to browser-ready TypeScript/TensorFlow.js to enable high-performance, client-side intelligence.
* **508 Accessibility Tools** - Prototyping applications that help developers automate and verify Section 508/WCAG compliance in modern SPAs.
    
## Recent Activity & Experience (AI/ML & Development)
    
* **AI Projects (`ai-projects` repository):** Developed and experimented with various AI concepts including:
  * **FieldGuide Assistant:** An AI-powered assistant for botanical information.
  * **Agent Orchestration:** Exploring multi-agent systems and their coordination.
  * **Extensive documentation and research** on Agents, RAG, LLMs, N-Shot Learning, and related AI topics.
  * **Research Paper Implementations**: Developed small-scale projects based on key research papers in the AI field to validate concepts and explore implementation details.
* **Contributions & Challenges (`coding-challenges` repository):**
  * Implemented a 'GFE Custom EventEmitter'.
  * Solved numerous Blind 75 and other LeetCode challenges, focusing on data structures and algorithms.
    
## Skills
    
* **Languages:** TypeScript, Python
* **AI/ML:** RAG, LLMs, Reinforcement Learning
* **Other:** System Design

## My Funnest Repos

### [ai-projects](https://github.com/pertrai1/ai-projects)
*A lab for production-ready AI implementations.*
* **FieldGuide Assistant:** Multi-document RAG system focused on context-aware retrieval.
* **Agent Orchestration:** Building frameworks that keep the human "in the loop," prioritizing developer agency over autonomous agent control.

### [coding-challenges](https://github.com/pertrai1/coding-challenges)
*A laboratory for problem-solving and meta-learning.*
* **Learning How to Learn:** Using challenges as a medium to refine **Active Recall** and **Spaced Repetition** techniques in a technical context.
* **First Principles:** Breaking down complex problems into primitive patterns (Graph theory, Dynamic Programming, Sliding Windows) to build a reusable mental library for system design.
* **Process over Product:** Each solution is an exercise in documenting the "why"—translating abstract requirements into clean, performant TypeScript/Python code.
